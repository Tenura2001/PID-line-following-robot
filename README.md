# Fast Line-Following Maze-Solving Car üöó‚ö°

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and hardware setup for a **high-speed line-following robot** that also solves mazes efficiently.  
The robot is built using:  
- **ESP32** microcontroller for advanced processing.  
- **500 RPM gear motors** for speed and precision.  
- **TB6612FNG motor driver** for motor control.  
- **PID control** for smooth line tracking.  

### Key Features
- **Adaptive Line Detection:** Switches between black and white line colors.  
- **PID Control Optimization:** Tune PID values via Bluetooth.  
- **Maze Solving Algorithm:** Implements an efficient solving mechanism for complex paths.
